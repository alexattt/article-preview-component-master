# Frontend Mentor challenge - Article preview card

<p>My version of Social proof section for Frontend mentor challenge (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/article-preview-component-dYBN_pYFT).</p>
<p>For this challenge I used plain HTML and SASS. Component is responsive!</p>
<p>Slightly struggled with Share social media section on mobile, but I understood some things that I will take into consideration later.</p>
<p>Solution page can be found here - https://alexattt.github.io/article-preview-component-master/</p>
